# Perceptron Implementation

This project is an implementation of the perceptron algorithm. In TestScript.m, I take 50 samples each from 2 Gaussian distributions; the samples are accepted on a condition that will keep them linearly separable. The perceptron algorithm then calculates and shows the hyperplane between the 2 populations.
